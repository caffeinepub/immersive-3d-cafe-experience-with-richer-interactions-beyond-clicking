  "summary": "REQ-42 appears partially implemented by updating code references to a 1024x1024 contour texture path in the environment/dressing, and REQ-43/REQ-44 appear implemented via reduced geometry segment counts and a more conservative Canvas configuration. However, the diff shows no new smaller texture asset being added, which is an explicit acceptance criterion for REQ-42. Additionally, the diff suggests some unrelated feature/documentation expansion in a summary file that is not part of the optimization request.",

      "requirement": "Include a smaller contour texture file in `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (1024x1024) and ensure the scene loads it instead of the 2048x2048 version without runtime missing-asset errors.",
      "reason": "Code references were updated to `/assets/generated/contour-texture-warm.dim_1024x1024.png`, but the diff shows no added asset file. This risks runtime 404/missing texture unless the file already existed (not evidenced in the diff).",
