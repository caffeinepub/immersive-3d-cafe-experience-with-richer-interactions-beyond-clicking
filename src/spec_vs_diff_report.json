      "reason": "CafeSceneDressing shows the larger label props (e.g., fontSize={140}), but the BasicCafeRoomFallback file is truncated before showing the menu board label usage; only an import/comment is visible, so the fallback implementation cannot be confirmed from the provided diff evidence.",
