  "summary": "The diff implements upgraded cafe furniture geometry/materials, improves the Menu prop into a clearer 3D coffee cup with a \"Menu\" label while preserving click/hover/press feedback, and adds multiple new non-interactive scene-dressing props (>=5) in plausible cafe locations. However, the diff summary also indicates several unrelated interaction/UI changes (onboarding behavior, help button, additional interaction systems) that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Onboarding overlay behavior changed so it no longer opens automatically on first visit; added ability to manually trigger via a help button.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is focused on 3D cafe realism/furniture/props and explicitly lists non-goals around adding new UI concepts; onboarding/help behavior changes were not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (App.tsx summary mentions onboarding no longer opens automatically; HelpButton can manually trigger)"

    },
    {
      "description": "Added/expanded interaction systems such as POI markers with gaze-based dwell detection, proximity zones with contextual prompts, an auto-opening door controller, and an inspectable draggable prop.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks for upgraded furniture and added scene dressing props, and does not request new interaction mechanics beyond maintaining the existing Menu cup click behavior.",

      "description": "Enhanced React Query hooks for contact message operations with runtime normalization, deployment diagnostics, and detailed backend failure logging.",
      "reason": "Not related to upgrading 3D furniture/props; BuildRequest also suggests backend changes are unnecessary for this request.",
