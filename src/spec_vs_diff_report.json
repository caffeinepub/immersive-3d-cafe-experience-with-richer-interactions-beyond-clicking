  "summary": "REQ-4, REQ-5, and REQ-6 appear implemented (additional dogs, in-scene MENU label, and warm café UI palette updates). Evidence is insufficient to confirm the GLB path fix (REQ-1) and the required scene composition changes for removing humans and adding extra seating clusters (REQ-2/REQ-3) in the active scene.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the 3D scene load failure caused by `/assets/models/furniture/table-chair-set.glb` returning HTML by ensuring the GLB is present/served at that exact path or updating code to a correct existing path under `frontend/public/assets/models/furniture/`.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added `.glb` under `frontend/public/assets/models/furniture/` and no shown code change that explicitly updates references to `/assets/models/furniture/table-chair-set.glb` or otherwise guarantees that exact path serves a GLB instead of HTML.",
