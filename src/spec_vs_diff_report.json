  "summary": "The diff shows updates to the fallback room (floor/ceiling overlays, wall textures, wall decor) and project metadata, but the provided truncated code does not include concrete evidence of an espresso/coffee machine prop being added on top of the counter or positioned/aligned per the counter (z = -5) requirements.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add a visible 3D coffee/espresso machine prop on top of the counter in the always-rendered fallback scene (shiny silver/chrome, casts/receives shadows).",
      "reason": "In the shown portion of the modified fallback scene, there is no mesh/group that clearly represents a coffee/espresso machine placed on the counter, nor any visible material settings demonstrating a chrome look (high metalness/low roughness) for such a prop. The comment mentions an espresso machine, but the truncated code excerpt does not show its implementation.",

      "requirement": "Place the coffee machine aligned with the counter placement (z aligned with counter group at z = -5), not overlapping existing fallback countertop props, and visible from the default camera start.",
      "reason": "No explicit position/transform for a coffee/espresso machine is visible in the provided diff excerpt, so alignment to the counter (z = -5), non-overlap with other countertop props, and visibility from the default camera cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
