    {
      "description": "Added/advertised fallback-room features unrelated to duplicating seating sets (e.g., very large \"Seven Balance\" label text and neon green frame glow on the menu board).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly exclude changes beyond duplicating the existing table+chair components; these UI/visual additions are not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/scene/environment/BasicCafeRoomFallback.tsx (header comment mentions large label text and neon green frame glow; imports WallFrameLabel and MenuBoardFrameGlow)"
