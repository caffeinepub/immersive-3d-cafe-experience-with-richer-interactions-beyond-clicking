# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the existing 3D cafe scene feel more like a real cafe by upgrading placeholder furniture, improving the “Menu” coffee cup prop readability, and adding richer non-interactive scene dressing while keeping the warm contour/topographic style.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the most primitive-looking furniture (counter, tables, seating) with more believable cafe furniture geometry/materials that match the current warm palette and contour/topographic identity.
- Improve the in-scene “Menu” coffee cup prop so it clearly reads as a cup and the label text “Menu” is legible from normal viewing angles, while preserving existing click/tap behavior to open the Menu panel.
- Add at least 5 additional non-interactive cafe props (scene dressing) placed in plausible locations (counter/back wall/seating area) to make the space feel lived-in, without adding new UI panels, routes, or backend changes.
- Ensure the scene continues to render without runtime errors and does not introduce an obvious performance regression.

**User-visible outcome:** The cafe environment looks more realistic and detailed with proper furniture and additional decor/props, and the “Menu” coffee cup is clearly visible and still opens the Menu panel when clicked/tapped.
